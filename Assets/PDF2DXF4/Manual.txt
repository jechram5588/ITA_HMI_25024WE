1.What the program does
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Do you get PDF files with CAD drawings inside? Now you can
  extract these drawings and save it as DXF file and open it
  in you CAD application.
  PDF 2 DXF can open PDF files and save all vector objects
  as DXF file. Version 2.0 can now also convert text objects! 
  Version 3.0 can also recognize lines in pictures and export
  the lines as dxf file.
  Version 4.0 has a function to vectorize all text objects.
  It can convert the complete page into a picture and then
  recognize the lines in this picture. And it can recognize
  lines in very large pictures in full resolution.
